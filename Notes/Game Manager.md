# GAME MANAGER 

Parent Scene should have the Game Manager empty entity with a script on it.
This script is going to call services and anything else needed to build.
This might be scene loading service, random number service, etc.

The script should be GameManagerScript.cs and should be created from a Start Up Script in Stride
