Rare Use:

Sequence Diagram - Use when the sequence of events is important

Communication Diagram - Useful for very complex functions that might be intricate between classes

State Diagram - Models specific states of something and shows its lifecycle

Object Diagram - Diagrams a class when instantiated, so you can visually see different objects at different states

Package Diagram - shows model elements, basically a high level overview? Seems a bit useless???

Composite Structure Diagram - Defines what's going on in the server, basically a less specific class diagrama, focused on defining behaviors.

Interaction Diagram - variant of the activity diagram, overfiew of the flow of actions, ratherthan what people do 

Timing Diagram - Shows cycle of something, like a watercycle
